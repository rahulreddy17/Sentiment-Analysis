# Sentiment-Analysis

I have been trying to analyse the Toyota Camry car reviews programatically for this mini project and all the reviews has been programatically downloaded from https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-camry/. Sentiment score has been calculated for each review and then I have used 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 reviews for training and the 2017 reviews for testing purposes to build a model.
